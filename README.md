# FirstGameUnity
This was my very first try to create a game in Unity3D.

It's kinda crappy, and I was honestly afraid to make this repo public.

It was one of my collegues to tell me to make this repo public and to not be afraid (thanks Giovanni).

Disclaimer: This game was created for a University subject (Digital Game Developement - Informatica, UniCT), and the main character was create for an animation short-movie i created for another subject (Computer Graphics - Informatica, UniCT).

So yeah, here we are.

If you want to try the game, just download this repo, then double click in -> FirstGameUnity/First Game - Requiem/Eseguibile/Requiem the Game.exe

At the beginning of the game, you can see the short movie I made for Computer Graphics.

If you want only to see the short movie, check this link to my channel: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Euw5hzXrLh0

As I said, it's aaaaaall very crappy, but it was a first attempt on both animation and game programming/design. Soo, yeah, please be gentle
